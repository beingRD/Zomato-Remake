A **SwiftUI** Project that attempts to remake the app selected screens with a simple UX design so that it can be easy for the user to browse and explore different restaurants and popular cuisines in the near by area and hence adding 2 features on the home screen such as offers and popular cuisines. Making an app with SwiftUI requires essentially one codebase for iPhones, iPads and the Mac.

This project helped me solidify my SwiftUI Fundamentals and also allowed me to dive into new areas of this brand new
and super powerful declarative UI by Apple.
